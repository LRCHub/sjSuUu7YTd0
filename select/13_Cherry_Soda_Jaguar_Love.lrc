[00:50.82] Sugar coated cherry soda puking on the lawn. Its six AM the party's over everybody's gone. Rode a mother fucking mastodon to my high school prom it's on it's on it's on it's on like immigrant song.
[01:02.52] Sugar coated cherry soda it's like the futures over it's like the curtains closing it's like the earth is sobbing. I plug my headphones in the sewer in the street listen to the pulse like an 808 beat.
[01:17.94] Hologram Jams.
[01:24.94] 
[02:00.46] Sugar coated cherry soda staining the sky red. The twilights a projector for the movies in my head. I was dead technically for a second in the sea octopus legs wrapped around my throat I couldn't breathe.
[02:31.18] Sugar coated cherry soda I am a lightning bolta I'm picking oranges in the fields where they bury soldiers.
[02:37.70] Sing it sing it loud child like lions in the wild like theres bullhorns in your mouth.
