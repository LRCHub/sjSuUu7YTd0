You look good in my dress
I get your friends to clean this mess
You look good in my clothes
I could feel where the doctor goes

My beautiful son
My beautiful soon
My beautiful sooon
My beautiful sooooon

Yeeeaaah
Nooo
Yeeeaaah
I know

He had ribbons in his hair
And lipstick was everywhere
You look good in my dress
You look good in my dress

My beautiful son
My beautiful soon
My beautiful sooon
My beautiful sooooon

Yeeeaaah
I know
I know

You're buried
Like me
You're buried

Yeeeaaah
I know
Yeeeaaah
I know

My beautiful son
My beautiful soon
My beautiful sooon
My beautiful son (start fade)
