Oh yeah, he wants to take you
Take you away from your life
Oh yeah, he wants to take you
Take you away from your life

Oh yeah, he wants to take you
Take you by the hand
Oh God, just let him rape you
Baby, I think you'll understand

Just you wait till everyone is hooked

Oh yeah, he wants to take you
Take you by the hand
Oh baby, let him break you
Then I think you'll understand

Are you gonna sit and watch me?
Watch me while I go down
Are you gonna sit and watch me?
Watch me while I drown

Oh God, he wants to take you
Take you away from your life
Oh God, he wants to break you
Take you away from your lies

Oh yeah, he wants to take you
Take you by the hand
Oh baby, let him break you
Then I think you'll understand

Are you gonna sit and watch me?
Watch me while I go down
Are you gonna sit and watch me?
Watch me while I drown

Oh God, he wants to take you
Take you away from your life
Oh God, he wants to break you
Take you away from your lies

Well, I sit on the corner and I drink drown soda

I'm gonna bomb the whole state of Minnesota
And it's been a while, I'm a little annoyed
I'm gonna fuck the whole state of Illinois
Yeah, I'm toiling in shit, he's got no place to go
I'm gonna fuck the whole state of Ohio
She sits on Broadway with her rattle

She's gonna fuck the whole city of Seattle
