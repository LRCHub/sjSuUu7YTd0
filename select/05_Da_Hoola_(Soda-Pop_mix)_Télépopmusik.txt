Let's do da hoola!

What's the consiquence
To the sequence of events
Sitting on a fence
All my money spent on the rent

Helpin' global debt
Heaven-sent remedy escapes me
So my mind gets ragey

Incense burns in the tent slowly,
The woman with the gun in her hand looks holy
Maybe I'll just follow the holy one
Cause I believe that she believes that I ain't the only one

My job is dead
But yeah yeah I hit you with a left
And a boggie from head to Bangladesh
Mad fresh
Just gets fresher
?,
?,
From a bag of treasure,
Whatever.

These days animals be gettin' clever,
Musta been breeding,
All?,
No?,
Moneys on the monkies,
When they start to rebel,
Soon they're be children of twelve,
More ice than Ray?,

Let's do da hoola,
(What's your name?),
Let's do da hoola,
Let's do da hoola,
(What's your name?),
Let's do da hoola,
(I'm dancin'),

Steppin' out,
Twenty-Seven microdots,
For the cyclops,
I drop more storms,
Than an equanox,

Everyones gone tabloid crazy,
Hip-hop babies,
Ram raving arts fan.

Super boy's gonna be in an indie band,
"Look at me man, look at me.Man!"

We've been through with the drunks,
On the underground,
Trying not to look at the women,
With thier heads down.

Especially the stupid ones,
The ones that fall asleep,
In the institutions,

What did they they think,
That they were doin'?
Gettin' comfortable,
In a world full of humans,

What did they think,
That they were doin'?
Gettin' comfortable,
In a world full of humans

Let's do da hoola,
(What's your name?),
Let's do da hoola,
Let's do da hoola,
(What's your name?),
Let's do da hoola,
(I'm dancin'),

Let's do da hoola,
(What's your name?).

Let's,
(What's your name?).

Let's,
(What's your name?).

Let's,
(What's your name?).

Let's do da hoola,
(I'm dancin').
